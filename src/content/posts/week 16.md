This week, we had a session by Ms. Engie Bashir on User Experience (UX)
& Prototyping. She started her session by explaining that UX is about
understanding users\' needs, values, abilities, and limitations when
using digital products. She also pointed out the importance of
prototyping and explained it as a concrete showcase of abstract ideas.

Ms Engie presented different tools we can use to prototype our ideas, be
it making a Low-Fidelity (L0-Fi) or High-Fidelity (Hi-Fi) prototype of
our project. She Highlighted using Paper or Cardboard prototypes for
Lo-Fi and Digital or Virtual prototyping (i.e., Modelling and
Simulation) for Hi-Fi prototypes. She stressed building the prototypes
to highlight the product\'s functional requirements and implementing a
good information architecture to allow the product to be easily used by
the clients. She ended the session by providing tools we could use for
prototyping, e.g., Marvel, Figma, Tinker CAD, etc.

# Reflection

This week, after the session on UX and prototyping, I started thinking
of how I wanted my project to look; I highlighted the functional
requirements and made some rough sketches of the project\'s different
parts. Hopefully, I can start making some 3D designs of the project
using Tinker CAD or Free CAD.
