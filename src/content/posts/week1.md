# Introduction

This week, Mrs Fehmida and Mr Roshan introduced us to the module and
gave us some vital information on research ethics and how it affects our
project.

They informed us about the university\'s commitment to maintaining high
standards of ethics in research. Ms Fehmida explained the significance
of maintaining high research ethics and when to consider research ethics
and provided materials to assist us in practising high research ethics.

Research ethics are essential if our project requires extra Human
involvement, Experiments on Animals, etc.

Mr Roshan then explained the task for the week by introducing us to a
first-cut proposal template. We had to fill out the template with the
aim, objectives, and project scope to explain our project to our
supervisors better. You can find the link to my first cut proposal
[here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1huQcrq7mzp6599PTvF5gqBaeJM935-I6/view?usp=sharing).

After the class, Mr Roshan sent our assigned supervisors to our emails
and instructed us to email them for a first meeting. You can check my
updates from my supervisor meetings by clicking on the "meeting with
supervisor" link.

# Reflection

This week, I finished work on my blog and started brainstorming project
ideas for my final year project. I presented all my ideas to my
supervisor for feedback, but I will keep thinking of new project ideas.
