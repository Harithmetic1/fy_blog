description: I reached out to Mr Judhi to update him on my project progress. I highlighted the progress on the AI model and the challenges of hosting the model on the Railway cloud server. I had no other issues to discuss with him, so we had a short encounter. Next week is reading week, so students and staff will not be in school. I will try to meet with him the week after.
