description: I met with my supervisor to review and sign my ethics form. He had no issues with the form, so he signed it. Afterwards, I updated him on the progress of my project, showed him the 3D model I designed for my botâ€™s base and asked his permission to use the 3D printer at school. He was so kind to let me use it. Next week, I will start working on the software and try to deploy the server to house the AI model.
