description: This week, I tried to meet with my supervisor to discuss the illustration I drew for my prototype. I discussed the different components of the prototype and asked my supervisor for feedback. He explained that I needed to simplify the solution, so instead of spinning the bins using a stepper motor to a central location for sorting, I could turn and tilt the flat plate on top using servo motors to reduce the overall power consumption.
