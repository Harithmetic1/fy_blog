description: This week, I met with my supervisor to present my project update. I informed him about issues with the ESP32 WIFI + Camera microcontroller. He tried to help me in fixing the issue but to no avail. We later decided to use the Arduino Uno to program the ESP32 instead of the ESP32 MB programmer, and the camera module worked. I have started using the ESP 32 camera module to take pictures and test the images with some AI waste classifier models I found online.
