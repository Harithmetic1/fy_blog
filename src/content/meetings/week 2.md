description: This week, after researching, I found a project I would enjoy working on, an AI-automated waste Recycling Bot. The idea looked complicated, so I approached my supervisor, who found a way to simplify it. Instead of detecting 4 different waste classes, I can detect two waste classes, e.g., Plastic/Can.  These waste classes will be based on how harmful they are to recycling. Also, he told me that I could use a material other than metal for the botâ€™s chassis. I will have to research how I want the device to look.
