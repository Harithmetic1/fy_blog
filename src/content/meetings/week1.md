description: This week, I met my supervisor, Dr. Judhi Prasetyo. I presented all my ideas to him, and he gave his feedback on all of them. He was able to provide me with a clear path in pursuing each of them. I like that he made all my ideas more feasible with some adjustments.  However, I am not content with all the ideas I presented to him.  I will continue searching for more ideas.
