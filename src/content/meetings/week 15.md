description: I met with my supervisor this week to finalise my project idea and present my blog. I laid out the plans for my project moving forward, and he advised me on what to do regarding training the AI model. He also told me to start by working on creating a cloud server and testing the model by sending images to the server using an API. After finishing my project proposal and literature review, I will start working on implementing the AI model on the server.
